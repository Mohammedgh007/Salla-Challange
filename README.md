Welcome to Salla Challange Repository


Since this is a demo, there are several non-working features, which were not required:
- user reset password
- user sign up
- user sign out 
TO REMARK:
- enum would have been included.
- more folders in components
- translations are used used per layout, component, or formatter. They are written now to save time.

important notes:
- cart is used locally, when storing too much data, it will remove the content because of browser restrictions.
